# Mahen Mahindaratne MBA, LLB

My name is **Mahen Mahindaratne**, and I am a qualified lawyer from Colombo, Sri Lanka. I hold an **LLB** from the University of London and an **MBA** from the Australian Institute of Business. My career journey has led me from law into the world of technology, where I am now pursuing coding both as a hobby and a professional skill.

I began my coding journey with **Scientific Computing** using Python, then transitioned to **Web Development**, where I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications. I specialize in designing and deploying both **static web applications** (using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and **dynamic web applications** that require server-side and client-side logic.

## Core Expertise

My core area of expertise is as a **MERN Stack Developer**, where I am proficient in:

- **MongoDB**
- **Express**
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**

I have successfully coded several projects using the MERN stack, ensuring high performance, scalability, and robust security. Additionally, I possess practical experience with **Django**, **SQLite**, **MySQL**, and **PostgreSQL**, making me well-versed in both NoSQL and relational databases.

## Tools & Platforms

- I use **VS Code** as my primary code editor and rely on **GitHub** for version control and project management.
- Many of my applications are deployed as **Docker** images on GitHub, demonstrating my ability to build and manage containerized applications.
- I also have experience hosting static websites on **GitHub Pages**, showcasing my ability to efficiently deploy and manage web content.

For dynamic web applications, I leverage platforms like **Render** to deploy and scale full-stack applications with ease. Render provides a seamless deployment process for **Node.js** and other backend technologies, ensuring that my web applications are reliable and scalable.

## Performance & Security

Additionally, I have experience working with **CDNs** like **Cloudflare** to optimize website performance and security, ensuring faster load times and protection against DDoS attacks.

## Payment Gateway Integration

I have successfully integrated popular payment gateways like **Stripe**, **PayPal**, and **Coinbase** into several applications, ensuring secure and efficient payment processing for users. I am also proficient in handling payment gateway SDKs, allowing for streamlined payment functionality in custom web solutions.

## Domain Management

In addition to my technical expertise, I am familiar with domain management through platforms like **GoDaddy**, where I have set up and configured custom domains, ensuring that web applications are properly branded and easily accessible.

I am continuously expanding my skill set to stay current with emerging technologies and best practices in web development. I am confident in my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.

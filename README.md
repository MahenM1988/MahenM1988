# Hi! I'm Mahen Mahindaratne 👋

**Lawyer turned Coder** | **Passionate about Scientific Computing** | **Explorer of New Knowledge**

After transitioning from law to web development, I now focus on **monetizing my coding skills**. However, my true passion lies in **Scientific Computing with Python**. Inspired by spy tech, I've even started working on my own version of Konboot (stay tuned!). One day, I hope to clone a server full of data using that magical USB (if only I had the right hardware...).

## 💻 Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, React
- **Tools & Platforms**: Redis, Docker, VS Code, Google Colab
- **Web Development**: MERN-stack applications, API development, Frontend/Backend
- **Scientific Computing**: Machine learning with Python, TensorFlow
- **Hobbies**: Continuously enriching my inner world, with the hope of sharing it with others soon
